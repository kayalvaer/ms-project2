<h1 align="center">Morabaraba Game</h1>

## Code Institute: Milestone Project 2

![Portfolio website](assets/imgs/Morabaraba-responsive.png)

Most commonly played in Southern Africa especially in Botswana, South Africa and Lesotho,
Morabaraba is a traditional two-player strategy board game.It is reported that Morabaraba boards carved in rock are dated to be at least 800 years old, therefore indicating a non-European origin. Originally played by headman when heading countries. It was used in the community as a way to mend and encourage peace and friendship among people. Allowing them to talk freely, take out anger and share happiness. Indeed it is a talking game. [Check this facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Mhele-Productions-109539297412881/videos)

It has some similarities to the Twelve Men's Morris, a variation on the Roman board game Nine Men's Morris. In this European game, the counters are most commonly referred to as men (mills), but in the South African game the counters are referred to as cows, the game being particularly popular amongst youth especially young men and those herding cattle.The Oxford English Dictionary, translate that the term "Morabaraba" is derived from the Southern Sotho "moraba-raba", meaning "mill" or to "go round in a circle".

This project is the second one, out of four Milestone Projects in the Full Stack Web Development Program I am attending at The Code Institute. The main requirements is to
build an interactive front-end site which responds to the users' actions using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.

<h1>1. Design Process (UX)</h1>

<span id="ux-goals"></span>

### 1.1 Project goals

- The goal of this project is the design an interactive front-end site. The site should consider the design principles in order to achieve a desired user experience for the targeted personas. This will take into consideration the typography, the color choice to match the target users and incorporate the african headman experience. The choice of sound as well was strategically selected to match the theme of the game.A game as developer i personally relate to and it is not yet popular among developers.
- Creating a game that is easy to understand and play through use of alert messages and giving steps on how to play Morabaraba game.

### 1.3 Design

#### Project scope

After researching the main goals of this project, Inspirational games similar to my project were searched online. My search started with looking for morabaraba games coded before and I found only two listed below, and both of them used a picture of an existing canvas or play board. The goal was to develop my own canvas with html and css. This was a challenge, however i managed to code it. Coding the diagonals were a bit complicated and i had to google online for tips inspiration in similar website games that already existed. I found these previous tic tac helpful, and the nine men´s mill game particularly useful like one below, as they gave me a realistic idea how i could code my project with a similar skill set:

- [Morabaraba Game by Lusani Masindi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRy2F_bOBqo&list=PL-1M9V7JEcXwdnu7_FEzxnaObSrXRSp12&index=20)
- [morabaraba by Kurt Rohlandt](https://github.com/qtotuan/mill-boardgame)
- [mill-boardgame by Procchio6 & qtotuan](https://github.com/qtotuan/mill-boardgame)
- [ThreeMensMorris by Rangavendra Raghavcreddy](https://github.com/raghavcreddy/ThreeMensMorris/blob/master/bootstrap-theme.min.css)

After making my research the scope of the project was broken down into must haves and nice to haves.

_**"Must-haves"**_

1. The game must achieve a positive user experience
2. The game must be appealing to the personas.
3. The game must load fast.
4. The game must have steps on how to play.
5. The game my engage with the users,vice-versa.
6. The game my track the users moves.
7. The game must notify users if they win or lose.
8. The game must give users the feeling of african origin related to the game.

_**"Nice-to-haves"**_

1. The game could have tokens available and won displayed instead of counts.
2. The game could allow user to input their name.
3. The user could choose to play against the computer or a second player.
4. The alerts to have a controlled blink styling.

- #### Structure Plane

Simplicity was the aim here, due to timeline. Four navigation list items were added, which were: "Logo Name" to name the game, "About" to tell about the game history, "Steps to play" to help the user with playing morabaraba and "Github" link to access my code for the game.

- #### Colour scheme
  The colours that are used for the start and game over screen are:
- ![#adff2f](https://via.placeholder.com/15/adff2f/000000?text=+) #ffab0d (Orange)
- ![#5d5ddb](https://via.placeholder.com/15/5d5ddb/000000?text=+) #ffffff (White)
- ![#06d6f8](https://via.placeholder.com/15/06d6f8/000000?text=+) #383737 (Dark grey)
- ![#e45015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e45015/000000?text=+) #ffffff (White)
- ![#cac7c7](https://via.placeholder.com/15/cac7c7/000000?text=+) #ffffff (White)
- ![#d47b06](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) #ffffff (White)

#Color palette designed on [Xd color palette](https://xd.adobe.com/view/2f4f2ab7-d326-408a-a4e4-15ff93b99f26-7a1c/)
[Portfolio website](assets/imgs/figma-color palette.png)

The color choice of this project was putting into consideration the history and motive of the gave. The light blue color to represent friendship, nature and rustic color to represent the sand which most of the "cowboys" had to draw the game on the sand and use bottle cans or stones found in the forest. Though if possible one can use a flat box or board, sketch the lines with black burned wood remains.

- #### Fonts

  The **press to start 2p** font has been used throughout the whole game. Sans Serif is the fallback in case the main font isn’t being imported to the site correctly. The press to start 2p fonts is used for the whole game including the title.

- #### Audio

  The sounds of the project has been inspired by the history of the game, coming for the southern african countries originally. My personal experience of the game in Africa when i was young and the culture related to it.All sounds that are used for the project are from Code [Zapsplat.com](https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/drums-and-percussion/).

  <span id="ux-wireframes"></span>

### 1.4 Wireframes

Paper wireframes and Mockup on figma was designed for the project. Most of the work was done on paper because of the strategic placing of the board nodes which were challenging.The mockups were designed with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/JByjPwrRtqQ5uZejpJUT8h/Untitled?node-id=3%3A0&scaling=min-zoom)

The wireframes were as follows:
![paper wireframes](assets/imgs/paper-drafts.png)

**Note:** I changed the layout of game by displaying the result numbers instead of the tokens. It can be included in the future expansion of the project.

<h1>4. Testing</h1>

## Testing During Development

Much of the testing my JavaScript code was done throughout the development process using `console.log` within each function to report on what variables and arrays were being generated at each stage of the game. Read the output and used breakpoint to check the location of my nodes and the movement action as i manually tested them. that allowed me to fix any code error on the process.

## Code Validation

### HTML

Used the W3C Markup Validation Service to test the validity of my HTML as I go and some errors were sorted.

### CSS

I used the W3C CSS Validation Service to test the validity of my CSS. It didn't flag any issues.

### JavaScript and JQuery

I used JSHint to test the validity of my JavaScript and JQuery.

### Responsiveness

Google Developer tools was used to test the layout of my site on multiple device sizes, and also shared the deployed site with family and friends for them to test on their devices too.

### Performance

Lighthouse tool on the Google Developer software was useful to test the performance of my game. It flagged several errors which some were resolved.
